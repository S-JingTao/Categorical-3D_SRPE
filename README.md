# Categorical-3D_SRPE: Diffusion-Driven Self-Supervised Network for Multi-Object 3D Shape Reconstruction and Categorical 6-DoF Pose Estimation
# Overview
#### This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the paper "Diffusion-Driven Self-Supervised Network for Multi-Object 3D Shape Reconstruction and Categorical 6-DoF Pose Estimation". we introduce a novel pretrain-to-reinforce paradigm that contributes to self-supervised categorical 6-DoF pose estimation and 3D shape reconstruction for multiple objects.
